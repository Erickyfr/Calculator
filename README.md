# Calculator
This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on multiple numbers. The program prompts the user to input the operation they want to perform, the number of values they want to use, and the values themselves. It then calculates and displays the result.
